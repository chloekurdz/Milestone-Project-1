# Milestone-Project-1

This is a simple browser trivia game composed of 10 questions, score results are calculated to determine if the player has won or lost. After clicking the play button that brings you to the gameplay page questions appear as a pop up in the browser prompting the player for their answers. 
Once the player has answered all 10 questions, their score is calculated and if it is over 8, a winner message pops up, anything less than that prompts the lose message. The pop up will then prompt the user to answer if they'd like to play again or not.

The game was made using simple html and javascript. Styling was originally done with css, but has been converted to scss.

The game can be accessed via live server launched from the homepage html file. Everything going further is prompted by buttons or pop ups.
